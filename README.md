# Crime-in-Philadelphia
## Capstone Project for DSCI 591 & DSCI 592, Crime in Philadelphia
### Introduction

DSCI 591 -
[https://github.com/hongson1218/Crime-in-Philadelphia/tree/master/Fall%2020-21]

For our project, we would like to conduct an analysis on a Philadelphia crime dataset published by OpenPhillyData. The dataset dates from 12-31-05 to 03-22-17 (majority of the dates are from 2006-2016). There are 14 total columns in this dataset. They include the district number, sector, dispatch date, dispatch time, location, general code, descriptions of the crime, and the district. This dataset was published to the public so people can assess the crimes happening in Philadelphia. For our exploratory data analysis, we will perform data cleansing, use data transformation to create new variables, and then create visualizations to answer questions around crimes.

To assist in getting more out of our analysis, we will be scraping Philadelphia weather data for Philadelphia from 2007 to 2018. The dataset includes the temperatures in Fahrenheit, the max and min temperature, environment information, wind, and precipitation. The data was formatted into PDF files and a dataset was formed [~4,000 rows and 15 columns].

DSCI 592 - [https://github.com/hongson1218/Crime-in-Philadelphia/tree/master/Winter%2020-21]

This is a continuation of the project in DSCI 591. For this term, Our proposed solution is to create multiple models that can predict and classify the type of crime. This can also help provide community insights on how to make improvements to reduce the crime from occuring in the first place.
